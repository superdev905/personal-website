#### Intro
I am currently the C.T.O. of [Arthena](https://arthena.com) where I work on building the most accurate models for pricing and valuating fine art. My primary job functions are as a data scientist and software engineer.
<br>
I am available to consult on interesting projects. I am especially interested in: social impact, education, inclusivity, and in applying machine learning to large data sets. I may even be available for pro-bono work depending on the time commitment and the project.
<br><br>
#### currently
At Arthena I have learned how to build teams and manage people, build relationships with customers, sell enterprise products, and build on-line predictive models for production environments. I've also learned how to build large web applications (see [arthena.com](https://arthena.com)).

#### Some History (Early Life): 
- I was born on February 5th, 1990. I am {{age}} years old.
- My parents put a computer in my bedroom when I was 3. It was an old Tandy that ran MS-DOS and could barely handle Wolfenstein 3D.

- We subscribed to AOL in 1995. I still remember installing it from a floppy disk onto our brand new Packard Bell.

- At 8, my parents bought me a Sony Mavica MVC-FD71 digital camera after I stole their SLR one too many times. It could fit 10 images to a floppy disk at a 0.3MP resolution. I still have it and it still works. I've been taking photographs ever since, now with a Nikon D750, D800, and occasionally with a Mamiya 6II. 

- At 10, I built my first website with Microsoft FrontPage. It was terrible.

- I was 11 when I built my first [Tesla Coil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_coil) (without the permission of my parents). Over the next few years, I built several more including one of the first audio modulated coils and one of the first DRSSTCs. 

- When I was 12, I set the all time high record at my local laser tag facility because I reverse engineered the charging station and weapon protocols with a photo-resistor, micro-cassette recorder, and lots of patience. I was unstoppable.

- At 13, I went to space camp and fell in love. I went back two more times and promised myself that I'd work in space. I've since worked on three generations of satellites.

- At 14, I was almost expelled for finding a backdoor into my high school's faculty directories and telling everyone but the faculty members about it. Later that year, I figured out how to turn off the internet firewall by editing system registry keys. I had learned an important lesson and only anonymously shared my work. 

- At 16, I participated in a foreign exchange program in Dortmund, Germany. Since then, I've gone back almost every year.

- 14 - 17, I played a lot of video games. My favorites included Counter Strike Source, Command and Conquer 3, Halo 2, and Age of Empires 3 (?)

- At 18, In the summer before college, my friends and I started playing Muggle Quidditch. We went on to start ~ 8 teams in the IQA including my team, the Buffalo Quidditch Society. At our best point, we were 3rd in the league. Although I don't play anymore, you can still see pictures of me holding a broom in a chess camp t-shirt on facebook. 

- At 19, I took my first graduate course, published my first paper, and added Computer Engineering as a second major. 

- At 20, I coauthored a grant to build a satellite and managed a 60+ person team through the end of undergrad. You can read more about that [here](https://ubnl.space/glados/).

You can ask me in person for stories that I'm afraid to share with the internet.
